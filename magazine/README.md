# Magazine Slicer

A simple Python utility for splitting the Logos magazine page images (PNG) into left and right halves so they can be put in `index.html`. This tool takes all `.png` files in a given folder, splits each image into two halves, and saves the left and right pages into separate folders.

## Requirements

Example environment setup:

```
conda create --name logos python=3.12
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
