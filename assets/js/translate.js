By organising these features atop a politically neutral technology stack, the network state can establish a degree of sovereignty against the prevailing nation-state system, enabling its citizens to administer their own affairs autonomously through voluntary consent-based governance protocols.",
            "p2": "Nation states, established with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, maintain sovereignty within their borders and not beyond them. Therefore, despite offering many advantages over the governance systems that predated them, they struggle to tackle modern, global problems, which demand coordination at the transnational level. Meanwhile, they often fail to address issues affecting their own citizens, whether through malicious intent or negligence.",
            "p3": "Technologies advance - few people continue to travel by horseback in the 21st century. Yet we continue to govern with technologies that are almost 380 years old. Now is the time to explore new governance systems that are more suited to the digitally connected world we live in today. Since network states and the technologies they're built on can administer governance digitally and across borders, they represent the next step in human societies."

            "p1": "A network state is a digitally native, value-aligned community that coordinates its actions around technologies that resist outside interference, enabling it to achieve a degree of sovereignty. Unlike traditional nation states that assert power through territorial control and inherited institutions, network states emerge from decentralised digital communities. These communities typically form around shared goals, belief systems, or missions, using communication and coordination technologies to develop institutions such as legal systems, economies, and governance frameworks.",
            "p2": "A key trait of network states is their ability to provision sovereign institutions without reliance on traditional nation states. They achieve this using technologies like blockchain, which allow distributed participants to come to consensus around decision making, even if outside forces want to disrupt the community's organisational capacity. For example, voting for a particular action will take place via a transparent, immutable on-chain mechanism, and network-state economies will often leverage cryptocurrencies that operate in parallel to the legacy financial system."
        },
        spread9: {
            "p1": "Since network-state institutions are deployed on permissionless technologies and are provisioned over the Internet rather than exclusively to those born on a specific piece of physical territory, they have a unique ability to provide entirely voluntary governance services. One can easily and affordably opt in or out of these institutions, giving rise to competition in the provisioning of governance services and \"polycentric\” legal systems.",
            "p2": "This ability for citizens to exit unfavourable systems, combined with the transparency of blockchain technology, creates a powerful incentive for network states to strive for efficiency and alignment with their people's values. Meanwhile, the same market forces disincentivise corruption and other wasteful practices that are commonplace within the current nation-state social order. This is similar to how companies in free-market economies strive to provide the best service or product for the lowest price to attract more customers - only network states attempt to enact policies that will attract and retain high-value citizens."

            "p1": "Many people who are already familiar with the concept of a network state attribute the idea to technologist Balaji Srinivasan and his 2022 book <a href=\"https://thenetworkstate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Network State: How to Start a New Country</a>. While the text gives the concept its most recent name and defines it concisely, it fails to delve into its ideological origins, largely ignoring an important body of work that long predates the usage of the term \"network state\".",
            "p2": "The seed of the network state idea can be found in the work of early cypherpunks and crypto-anarchist writers, namely the godfather of crypto-anarchism, Timothy May. He was one of the first to write about the concept in a 1992 article, <a href=\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/libertaria-in-cyberspace/\" target=\"_blank\">Libertaria in Cyberspace</a>, in which he described the idea as \"Crypto Libertaria\", arguing that <i>\"An arbitrarily large number of separate 'nations' can simultaneously exist.\"</i> This allows for rapid experimentation, self-selection, and evolution.",
            "p3": "This early vision foresaw a refuge for individuals to voluntarily exit from the state and coercive actors by protecting their \"true names\" via privacy-enhancing protocols and strong cryptography. May was not alone in his thinking, and several other texts published during the 1990s documented the need for governance structures within the realm of cyberspace.",
            "p4": "The American philosopher and co-author of <a href=\"https://logos.co/farewell-to-westphalia\" target=\"_blank\">Farewell to Westphalia</a>, Peter Ludlow, anthologised several of these texts in a collection published in 2001 and titled <i>\"Crypto Anarchy, Cyberspaces, and Pirate Utopias\"</i>.",
            "p5": "Around the time that the cypherpunk visionaries were theorising about the possibility of cyberspace governance, online communities were forming, highlighting the need for digitally mediated governance processes. A text-based virtual reality environment from the early 1990s, known as LambdaMOO, introduced a community governance system after a player began subjecting others to unsolicited virtual sexual acts. This digital world's nascent legal system included petition systems, voting, and mechanisms for dispute resolution. Later examples of purely virtual worlds, such as Ultima Online and Everquest, would support economies and populations exceeding those of recognised nation states, further validating the need for and potential of cyberspace governance.",
            "p6": "Although some early online communities began implementing rudimentary versions of the kind of digital-first governance these theorists envisioned, the issue of sovereignty remained. For digitally mediated governance systems to truly coexist with or even rival those of the nation state, they needed to be able to withstand attempts to undermine them. And given that such systems would, by their very nature, undermine nation-state sovereignty in some domains, those attempts would likely originate from very powerful actors. Then came Bitcoin."

            "p5": "По времето когато визионерите от cypherpunk теоретизираха за възможността за управление на киберпространството, се формираха онлайн общности, които подчертаваха необходимостта от цифрови процеси на управление. Текстова среда за виртуална реалност от началото на 90-те години, известна като LambdaMOO, въведе система за управление на общността, след като един играч започна да подлага другите на нежелани виртуални сексуални действия. Зараждащата се правна система на този цифров свят включваше системи за петиции, гласуване и механизми за разрешаване на спорове. По-късни примери за чисто виртуални светове, като Ultima Online и Everquest, поддържаха икономики и население надхвърлящи тези на признатите национални държави, което допълнително потвърди необходимостта и потенциала на управлението на киберпространството.",
            "p6": "Въпреки че някои ранни онлайн общности започнаха да прилагат елементарни версии на вида управление ориентирано към цифровите технологии, което тези теоретици предвиждаха, въпросът за суверенитета остана. За да могат системите за управление, опосредствани чрез цифрови технологии, да съжителстват наистина с тези на националната държава или дори да им се противопоставят, те трябва да бъдат в състояние да устоят на опитите да бъдат подкопани. И като се има предвид че такива системи по своята същност биха подкопали суверенитета на националната държава в някои области, тези опити вероятно би трябвало да произхождат от много мощни участници. Тогава се появи Bitcoin."
